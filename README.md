# Password Cracking using MPI

This project is all about cracking/matching passwords from a large list of passwords with High Performance Computing or parallel processing
via MPI (Message Passing Interface). The process of matching passwords from the list is divided amongst the number of processes specified
(given as input) thus, dividing the load and ensuring faster matching than a serial counterpart.

The password file used can be downloaded from: http://dazzlepod.com/site_media/txt/passwords.txt
